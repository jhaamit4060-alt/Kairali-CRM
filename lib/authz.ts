// Server-side identity and authorization predicates over the signed session.
//
// Phase 8 rollout step 2 (docs/PHASE_8_RBAC_AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX.md §8): one
// helper that reads the signed `kairali_user` cookie and answers "who is this
// and what may they do", so the four routes that already gate (§5.3) stop
// reimplementing role normalization in four files (M9). The three *spellings*
// survive on purpose — see `hasAdminRole` — but there is one implementation.
//
// **Four importers, one per gated route — rollout step 6 is complete.**
// `app/api/test-db/route.ts` and `app/api/debug-leads/route.ts` call
// `getSessionUser`; `app/api/received-leads/route.ts` and
// `app/api/crr-calling/bookings/route.ts` call `getSessionUserResult`, because
// their 401/403 bodies distinguish "no cookie" from "cookie did not verify".
// All four now also take their role and permission rules from here — through
// `hasAdminRole`, `hasPermission`, `hasAnyPermission`, and `getPermissions`.
//
// The role predicate they took is `hasAdminRole`, **not** the folding
// `normalizeRole`. `normalizeRole` is still adopted by nothing: it is
// simultaneously wider and narrower than every live route rule (see its comment),
// and ratifying its vocabulary is still owner decision D1. `hasAdminRole` instead
// reproduces each route's existing spelling byte for byte, so consolidating moved
// no role decision in either direction.
//
// Adding checks to any *other* route is steps 10-13 and remains deferred for
// owner route-by-route policy mapping (D1/D3/D8).
//
// Server-only: it reaches into `lib/session.ts`, which uses Node's `crypto`.
// It must never be imported from a client component — the browser has its own
// `hasPermission` in `hooks/use-auth.tsx` and the two are not interchangeable.
//
// What this module deliberately does **not** do:
//   - It enforces no payload schema. `verifySessionCookieValue` returns `any`
//     and every consumer trusts the upstream login payload's fields verbatim
//     (§2.1). Validating `role`/`permissions`/`action` at verification time is
//     matrix decision D9 — an owner call, because a stricter schema logs out
//     every live session whose payload does not match. So the predicates here
//     read a loose value and answer "no" on anything unusable, rather than
//     rejecting the session itself.
//   - It knows nothing about `user.action`. There is no server-side
//     action-permission concept (M13) and inventing one is D8 / step 13.
//   - It does not touch `/api/calendar/mobile`, `/api/meetings/*`, mobile
//     authentication, or the Meetings CORS policy (§1, owner-deferred).

// `String(user?.role ?? '').trim().toLowerCase()` (test-db, debug-leads),
// `String(user?.role || '').toLowerCase()` with no trim (received-leads), and
// a raw comparison with no normalization at all (crr-calling/bookings).
//
// Case and separator are both folded because the repository already carries
// every style: `super_admin`/`admin` snake_case in the four gated routes,
// `ADMIN` upper-case in `hooks/use-booking-auth.tsx:23`/`98`, `superVisor`
// camelCase and `fo_manager` snake_case side by side in the
// `actionPermissionsByPageByRole` keys (`hooks/use-auth.tsx:81-82`, M5), and
// `Front Office`/`Medical`-style spaced values in the `Department` union. So
// `Travel Consultant`, `travel-consultant`, and `travel_consultant` all land on
// `travel_consultant`, and `Calling Agent` on `calling_agent`, without this
// module inventing an alias table: no alias is asserted between two *different*
// words, only between spellings of the same one. (Neither `travel_consultant`
// nor `calling_agent` occurs anywhere in this repository today — the real role
// vocabulary lives in the upstream login payload, which §9 records as
// unverified from here.)
//
// A non-string role normalizes to '' and therefore matches nothing. That is one
// deliberate tightening over `String(user?.role ?? '')`, which would coerce a
// pathological `role: ['admin']` into the string `'admin'` and grant it. No
// route changes behavior from it today, since nothing calls this yet.
//
// Those two properties are exactly why none of the four gated routes calls this,
// or `hasRole`/`hasAnyRole` built on it. Against each route's live rule this
// function is *both* wider and narrower: wider on `super admin`, `super-admin`,
// and `_admin_`, all of which land on an admin role here and are rejected by all
// four routes today (`crr-calling/bookings` additionally rejects plain `Admin`,
// since it compares raw); narrower on a non-string `role`. Either direction
// changes who reaches a diagnostic endpoint or a booking write by an amount §9
// of the matrix records as unmeasurable from this repository, so ratifying this
// vocabulary stays an owner call (M9, D1). The four routes consolidated on
// `hasAdminRole` instead, which folds nothing.
//
// This function is therefore currently used only by `hasRole`/`hasAnyRole`,
// which are in turn used by nothing. They are kept as the shape D1 would adopt.

// The same read as `getSessionUser`, but keeping the two failure states apart.
//
// `getSessionUser` collapses "no cookie was sent" and "a cookie was sent and did
// not verify" into one `null`. That is why two of the four gated routes could
// not take it: `app/api/received-leads/route.ts` and
// `app/api/crr-calling/bookings/route.ts` answer `Access denied: Not logged in`
// for the first and `Access denied: Invalid session` for the second, so
// substituting a single `null` there would merge two distinct response bodies
// (§5.3, M9). This variant reads the same `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` through the same
// `verifySessionCookieValue` and reports which of the two happened, so a route
// can adopt it without moving a single response. Both now do — and the status
// each pairs with those bodies is the route's own business, not this helper's:
// `received-leads` answers 401 for both, `crr-calling/bookings` answers 401 for
// both on GET and 403 for both on POST, all four unchanged by the adoption.
//
// The three states are exactly the tests the callers already run, in the order
// they already run them:
//   - `missing` — no `NextRequest`/cookie value in hand, or a cookie value that
//     is absent or empty. Their `if (!userCookie)`.
//   - `invalid` — a cookie value that `verifySessionCookieValue` answered falsy
//     for: bad shape, signature mismatch, unparseable payload, elapsed expiry,
//     or a well-signed payload whose `user` field is itself falsy. Their
//     `if (!user)`.
//   - `valid` — anything else, with `user` verbatim as the verifier returned it.
//
// It is deliberately **not** a schema check. Nothing about a truthy payload is
// inspected — no `role`, `permissions`, or `action` field is read, coerced, or
// required — so no session that verifies today stops verifying (D9 stays open,
// for the same reason `getSessionUser` leaves it open).

// files. Collapsing them to one is the owner call, and when D1 answers, this
